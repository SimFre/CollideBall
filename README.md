# CollideBall

This is a simple, but really annoying game made in my school years,
sometime in the 2002-2003 era. Made public for historical reasons.

Initial idea was akin to breakout, but turned out too hard to even
bother with the blocks.

Build in ancient Visual Basic.

# Instructions

Move the cursor to move the paddles to save both balls from exiting the screen.

Hit *F2* to reset.

# Known bugs

* The cursor is not captured by the window, so don't click outside.
* Collition detection is awful. The ball(s) can get stuck inside the paddle.
* Start trajectory is same as the balls last hit if game was reset.
